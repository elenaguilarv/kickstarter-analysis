# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends for Louise who is looking to fund her own theater campaign.

According to the central tendency and deviation values it is recommended that Louise prepares a campaign budget goal of about $4,000.
When basing the outcomes of a project on time (launch date) the data shows it is most ideal she launch a campaign in the early summer months, particularly the month of May.
