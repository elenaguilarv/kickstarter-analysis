# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends for client who is looking to fund her own theater campaign.
### Challenge (Written Report)
#### Conclusions
1. Theater plays are generally a successful category in kickstarter projects, while taking some things into consideration.![ParentCategory.png](https://github.com/elenaguilarv/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/ParentCategory.png)
2. When basing the outcomes of a project on time (launch date), the data shows it is most ideal to launch a theater campaign in the early summer months, particularly the month of May where it reaches a maximum of 111 successful campaigns out of 839 for all months.

3. When basing the outcomes of project on the amount of a budget goal, the data shows the most successful campaigns (~75% success rate) for plays tend to not exceed $5,000.

#### Limitations and Suggestions
1. The dataset is limited by not showing how much time passed between each campaign's launch date and the deadline and if or how that contributed to its success. It would be useful to use a formula to take the amount of time (in days) between the launch date and deadline and using that data to create a graph where the X-axis shows length of time a campaign was open for (in different time ranges) and the Y-axis as the count of outcomes for each campaign categorized as plays. This could further reveal how the length of time a campaign is open for actually contributes to its ultimate success or failure.  
2. Another useful visual tool would be to create a bar graph that shows the relationship between those successful campaigns under budget goals of $5,000 and how many took place during the summer months or May compared to all other months of the year.
